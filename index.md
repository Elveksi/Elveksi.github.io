This blog post is for enthusiastic snow or Christmas individuals who 

eagerly wish to know the snow situation during December. So, the main

goal of the project is to predict snow depth in December in Helsinki.

After reading this blog post you can already begin to plan your Christmas

holidays in advance: can you stay comfortably in Helsinki or do you

need to buy tickets to the Lapland? For a Finnish person this question

is absolutely existential and our exceptional solution will bring

a massive relief for these individuals.
